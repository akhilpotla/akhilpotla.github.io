title: Announcing My Blog
---

Welcome to my blog!

This is where I am going to share my ideas on software engineering, normal
engineering, and data science. I intend to publish at least once a
month, perhaps more.

I am about to be an engineering PhD candidate starting January 2020, but right
now I am taking a self imposed sabbatical (bumming around) in Berkeley,
California.
