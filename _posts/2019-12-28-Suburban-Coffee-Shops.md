title: The Woeful State of Suburban Coffee Shops
---

Anyone who has lived in the suburbs knows that your options for coffee are
either Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts. I haven’t been to Dunkin Donuts in forever,
but I go to Starbucks every few months just to remind myself why I typically
don’t go. The coffee is terrible. If you want a milkshake, Starbucks is the
best place on the planet, but their black coffee, aka coffee, is atrocious.

Unfortunately, local coffee shops in the suburbs are few and far between. They
are usually passed up for the Starbucks across the street. I implore people who
live in the suburbs to not go to Starbucks. Support your local coffee shop.

This image below is a picture I took at 9 am on a Monday at my local coffee
shop. Pathetic. I am sure the nearby Starbucks is packed with people working
from home. This place has good coffee, super fast internet, and good design.
Why do we do this?
