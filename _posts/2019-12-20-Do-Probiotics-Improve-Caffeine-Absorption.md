title: Do Probiotics Improve Caffeine Absorption?
---

We know that probiotics can [impact nutrient
absorption](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0884533611436116).
We know some strains, such as [L.
Reuteri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactobacillus_reuteri#General_health_2),
can help in cases where growth is inhibited by malnutrition. So why wouldnâ€™t
this apply to caffeine?

The past 3 weeks, I have been drinking kefir to help with my IBS, and I noticed
I have been getting wired on just 12 oz of coffee. Previously I could drink two
coffees before bed and sleep just fine. Now, I get restless off of what used to
be a trivial amount of coffee to me.

The problem is this is an n=1 observation. Also, I might just be feeling
fantastic not having to deal with IBS symptoms. Therefore, it could have
nothing to do with the coffee, and I am just experiencing normal health. In
addition to all of this, other variables could confound my observations.

However, I would like to see research about this. Researchers could give
caffeine to mice with different microbiomes to see how it impacts serum
caffeine concentrations. Then the microbiome could be exchanged to see if the
impact of the caffeine changes to match those of the original mice.
