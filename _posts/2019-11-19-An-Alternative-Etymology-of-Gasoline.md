title: An Alternative Etymology of Gasoline
---

Why do we call the liquid we put in our cars gas?

[Gas comes from gasoline](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/gasoline), which comes
from cazeline, which comes from combining John Cassell’s surname and -eline
(elaion meaning “olive oil” in Greek).

Just like in English, Azeris call oil, “black gold”. [“qara
qızıl”](https://youtu.be/rQAL6OXOqbg?t=30) (pronounced “gara gizil”) in Azeri.
Gizil, the Azeri word for gold, combined with -eline yields “gizeline.”
Suspiciously close to gasoline. Perhaps there is some connection, after all the
city of Baku alone produced over 50% of the world’s oil at the start of World
War I.

This does not prove gasoline comes from a word found in a Turkic language in
the Caucasus, but it is an interesting theory. Interesting because even without
John Cassell, we might have still been saying “gasoline.” Though “petrol” is
still probably a more likely candidate.
