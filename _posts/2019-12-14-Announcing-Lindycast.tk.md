title: Announcing lindycast.tk

There are so many things in the world that can and should be considered through
a Lindy lens. The Lindy Effect examines what is hiding risks and hasnâ€™t been
exposed yet. This uses knowledge of history and human nature to examine various
contemporary phenomena to see what might be harmful and useless. It is a portal
to the risk management heuristics and wisdom of the ancients.

The man that has done the most to help educate the world on the Lindy Effect,
in addition to Nassim Taleb, is Paul Skallas. You can find him on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/PaulSkallas).

He does frequent live casts where you can ask all your Lindy related questions
live. They are immensely valuable and one should try to engage in these, but
the times of the live streams are not always convenient for people.
[lindycast.tk](http://www.lindycast.tk) is a website that is regularly updated
with links to all the LindyCasts so people can at their
convenience.
